## LDAvis-TopicModelling

This code is an example of using the Gensim library to perform topic modeling and visualize them for a given set of tweets. It uses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to discover topics within the tweet data. The coherence score is used to measure the interpretability and quality of the discovered topics.
In this notebook, I will walk through the tutorial provided at this [link](https://neptune.ai/blog/pyldavis-topic-modelling-exploration-tool-that-every-nlp-data-scientist-should-know) and try to run a part of it in GoogleColab.
